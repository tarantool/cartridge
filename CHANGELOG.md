# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Enhanced in WebUI

- Prettier errors displaying.

- Error stacktrace received from the backend is shown in notifications

## [2.1.2] - 2020-04-24

### Fixed

- Avoid trimming `console_sock` if it's name is too long.

- Fix file descriptors leak during box recovery.

- Support `console_sock` option in stateboard as well as notify socket
  and other box options similar to regular cartridge instances.

## [2.1.1] - 2020-04-20

### Fixed

- Frontend core update: fix route mapping

## [2.1.0] - 2020-04-16

### Added

- Implement stateful failover mode. You can read more in "Failover
  architecture" documentation topic (see `failover.md`).

- Respect `box.cfg` options `wal_dir`, `memtx_dir`, `vinyl_dir`. They
  can be either absolute or relative - in the later case it's calculated
  relative to `cartridge.workdir`.

- New option in `cartridge.cfg({upgrade_schema=...})`
  to automatically upgrade schema to modern tarantool version
  (only for leader). It also has been added for `argparse`.

- Extend GraphQL `issues` API with various topics: `replication`,
  `failover`, `memory`, `clock`. Make thresholds configurable via
  argparse.

### Changed

- Make GraphQL validation stricter: scalar values can't have
  sub-selections; composite types must have sub-selections; omitting
  non-nullable arguments in variable list is forbidden. Your code **may
  be affected** if it doesn't conform GraphQL specification.

- GraphQL query `auth_params` returns "fullname" (if it was specified)
  instead of "username".

- Update `errors` dependency to 2.1.3.

- Update `ddl` dependency to 1.1.0.

### Deprecated

Lua API:

- `cartridge.admin_get_failover` -> `cartridge.failover_get_params`
- `cartridge.admin_enable/disable_failover` -> `cartridge.failover_set_params`

GraphQL API:

- `query {cluster {failover} }` -> `query {cluster {failover_params {...} } }`
- `mutation {cluster {failover()} }` -> `mutation {cluster {failover_params() {...} } }`

### Fixed

- Properly handle nested input object in GraphQL:
```graphql
mutation($uuid: String!) {
  cluster { edit_topology(servers: [{uuid: $uuid ...}]) {} }
}
```

- Show WebUI notification on successful config upload.

- Repair GraphQL queries `add_user`, `issues` on uninitialized instance.

### Enhanced in WebUI

- Show "You are here" marker.

- Show application and instance names in app title.

- Indicate replication and failover issues.

- Fix bug with multiple menu items selected.

- Refactor pages filtering, forbid opening blacklisted pages.

- Enable JS chunks caching.

## [2.0.2] - 2020-03-17

### Added

- Expose membership options in `argparse` module (edit them with
  environment variables and command-line arguments).

- New internal module to handle `.tar` files.

Lua API:

- `cartridge.cfg({webui_blacklist = {'/admin/code', ...}})`: blacklist
  certain WebUI pages.

- `cartridge.get_schema()` referencing older `_G.cartridge_get_schema`.

- `cartridge.set_schema()` referencing older `_G.cartridge_set_schema`.

GraphQL API:

- Make use of GraphQL error extensions: provide additional information
  about `class_name` and `stack` of original error.

- `cluster{ issues{ level message ... }}`: obtain more details on
  replication status

- `cluster{ self {...} }`: new fields `app_name`, `instance_name`.

- `servers{ boxinfo { cartridge {...} }}`: new fields `version`,
  `state`, `error`.

Test helpers:

- Allow specifying `all_rw` replicaset flag in luatest helpers.

- Add `cluster({env = ...})` option for specifying clusterwide
  environment variables.

### Changed

- Remove redundant topology availability checks from two-phase commit.

- Prevent instance state transition from `ConnectingFullmesh` to
  `OperationError` if replication fails to connect or to sync. Since now
  such fails result in staying in `ConnectingFullmesh` state until it
  succeeds.

- Specifying `pool.connect()` options `user`, `password`,
  `reconnect_after` are deprecated and ignored, they never worked as
  intended and will never do. Option `connect_timeout` is deprecated,
  but for backward compatibility treated as `wait_connected`.

### Fixed

- Fix DDL failure if `spaces` field is `null` in input schema.

- Check content of `cluster_cookie` for absence of special
  characters so it doesn't break the authorization.
  Allowed symbols are `[a-zA-Z0-9_.~-]`.

- Drop remote-control connections after full-featured `box.cfg` becomes
  available to prevent clients from using limited functionality for too
  long. During instance recovery remote-control won't accept any
  connections: clients wait for box.cfg to finish recovery.

- Update errors rock dependency to 2.1.2: eliminate duplicate stack
  trace from `error.str` field.

- Apply `custom_proc_title` setting without waiting for `box.cfg`.

- Make GraphQL compatible with `req:read_cached()` call in httpd hooks.

- Avoid "attempt to index nil value" error when using rpc on an
  uninitialized instance.

### Enhanced in WebUI

- Add an ability to hide certain WebUI pages.

- Validate YAML in code editor WebUI.

- Fix showing errors in Code editor page.

- Remember last open file in Code editor page.
  Open first file when local storage is empty.

- Expand file tree in Code editor page by default.

- Show Cartridge version in server info dialog.

- Server alias is clickable in replicaset list.

- Show networking errors in splash panel instead of notifications.

- Accept float values for vshard-storage weight.

## [2.0.1] - 2020-01-15

### Added

- Expose `TARANTOOL_DEMO_URI` environment variable in GraphQL query
  `cluster{ self{demo_uri} }` for demo purposes.

### Fixed

- Notifications in schema editor WebUI.

- Fix GraphQL `servers` query compatibility with old cartridge versions.

- Two-phase commit backward compatibility with v1.2.0.

## [2.0.0] - 2019-12-27

### Added

- Use for frontend part single point of configuration HTTP handlers.
  As example: you can add your own client HTTP middleware for auth.

- Built-in DDL schema management. Schema is a part of clusterwide
  configuration. It's applied to every instance in cluster.

- DDL schema editor and code editor pages in WebUI.

- Instances now have internal state machine which helps to manage
  cluster operation and protect from invalid state transitions.

- WebUI checkbox to specify `all_rw` replicaset property.

- GraphQL API for clusterwide configuration management.

- Measure clock difference across instances and provide `clock_delta`
  in GraphQL `servers` query and in `admin.get_servers()` Lua API.

- New option in `rpc_call(..., {uri=...})` to perform a call
  on a particular uri.

### Changed

- `cartridge.rpc_get_candidates()` doesn't return error "No remotes with
  role available" anymore, empty table is returned instead.
  **(incompatible change)**

- Base advertise port in luatest helpers changed from 33000 to 13300,
  which is outside `ip_local_port_range`. Using port from local range
  usually caused tests failing with an error "address already in use".
  (*incompatible change*, but affects tests only)

- Whole new way to bootstrap instances. Instead of polling membership
  for getting clusterwide config the instance now start Remote Control
  Server (with limited iproto protocol functionality) on the same port.
  Two-phase commit is then executed over net.box connection.
  (**major change**, but still compatible)

- Failover isn't triggered on `suspect` instance state anymore

- Functions `admin.get_servers`, `get_replicasets` and similar GraphQL
  queries now return an error if the instance handling the request is in
  state `InitError` or `BootError`.

- Clusterwide configuration is now represented with a file tree.
  All sections that were tables are saved to separate `.yml` files.
  Compatibility with the old-style configuration is preserved.
  Accessing unmarshalled sections with `get_readonly/deepcopy` methods
  is provided without `.yml` extension as earlier.
  (**major change**, but still compatible)

- After an old leader restarts it'll try to sync with an active one
  before taking the leadership again so that failover doesn't switch too
  early before leader finishes recovery. If replication setup fails the
  instance enters the `OperationError` state, which can be avoided by
  explicitly specifying `replication_connect_quorum = 1` (or 0).
  **(major change)**

- Option `{prefer_local = false}` in `rpc_call` makes it always use
  netbox connection, even to connect self. It never tries to perform
  call locally.

- Update `vshard` dependency to 0.1.14.

### Removed

- Function `cartridge.bootstrap` is removed. Use `admin_edit_topology`
  interad. **(incompatible change)**

- Misspelled role callback `validate` is now removed completely.
  Keep using `validate_config`.

### Fixed

- Arrange proper failover triggering: don't miss events, don't trigger
  if nothing changed. Fix races in calling `apply_config` between
  failover and two-phase commit.

- Race condition when creating working directory.

- Hide users page in WebUI when auth backend implements no user
  management functions. Enable auth switcher is displayed on main
  cluster page in this case.

- Displaying boolean values in server details.

- Add deduplication for WebUI notifications: no more spam.

- Automatically choose default vshard group in create and edit
  replicaset modals.

- Enhance WebUI modals scrolling.

## [1.2.0] - 2019-10-21

### Added

- 'Auto' placeholder to weight input in the Replicaset forms.

- 'Select all' and 'Deselect all' buttons to roles field in Replicaset add and edit forms.

- Refresh replicaset list in UI after topology edit actions: bootstrap, join, expel,
  probe, replicaset edit.

- New Lua API `cartridge.http_authorize_request()` suitable for checking
  HTTP request headers.

- New Lua API `cartridge.http_render_response()` for generating HTTP
  response with proper `Set-Cookie` headers.

- New Lua API `cartridge.http_get_username()` to check authorization of
  active HTTP session.

- New Lua API `cartridge.rpc_get_candidates()` to get list
  of instances suitable for performing a remote call.

- Network error notification in UI.

- Allow specifying vshard storage group in test helpers.

### Changed

- Get UI components from Tarantool UI-Kit

- When recovering from snapshot, instances are started read-only.
  It is still possible to override it by argparse (command line
  arguments or environment variables)

### Fixed

- Editing topology with `failover_priority` argument.
- Now `cartridge.rpc.get_candidates()` returns value as specified in doc.
  Also it accepts new option `healthy_only` to filter instances which
  have membership status healthy.

- Replicaset weight tooltip in replicasets list

- Total buckets count in buckets tooltip

- Validation error in user edit form

- Leader flag in server details modal

- Human-readable error for invalid GrqphQL queries:
  `Field "x" is not defined on type "String"`

- User management error "attempt to index nil value" when one of users
  has empty e-mail value

- Catch `rpc_call` errors when they are performed locally

## [1.1.0] - 2019-09-24

### Added

- New Lua API `admin_edit_topology` has been added to unite multiple others:
  `admin_edit_replicaset`, `admin_edit_server`, `admin_join_server`,
  `admin_expel_server`. It's suitable for editing multiple servers/replicasets
  at once. It can be used for bootstrapping cluster from scratch, joining a
  server to an existing replicaset, creating new replicaset with one or more
  servers, editing uri/labels of servers, disabling or expelling servers.

- Similar API is implemented in a GraphQL mutation `cluster{edit_topology()}`.

- New GraphQL mutation `cluster { edit_vshard_options }` is suitable for
  fine-tuning vshard options: `rebalancer_max_receiving`, `collect_lua_garbage`,
  `sync_timeout`, `collect_bucket_garbage_interval`,
  `rebalancer_disbalance_threshold`.

### Changed

- Both bootstrapping from scratch and patching topology in clusterwide config automatically probe
  servers, which aren't added to membership yet (earlier it influenced join_server mutation only).
  This is a prerequisite for multijoin api implementation.

- WebUI users page is hidden if auth_backend doesn't provide list_users callback.

### Deprecated

Lua API:

- `cartridge.admin_edit_replicaset()`
- `cartridge.admin_edit_server()`
- `cartridge.admin_join_server()`
- `cartridge.admin_expel_server()`

GraphQL API:

- `mutation{ edit_replicaset() }`
- `mutation{ edit_server() }`
- `mutation{ join_server() }`
- `mutation{ expel_server() }`

### Fixed

- Protect `users_acl` and `auth` sections when downloading clusterwide config.
  Also forbid uploading them.

## [1.0.0] - 2019-08-29

### Added

- New parameter `topology.replicasets[].all_rw` in clusterwide config for configuring
  all instances in the replicaset as `read_only = false`.
  It can be managed with both GraphQL and Lua API `edit_replicaset`.

- Remote Control server - a replacement for the `box.cfg({listen})`,
  with limited functionality, independent on `box.cfg`.
  The server is only to be used internally for bootstrapping new
  instances.

- New module `argparse` for gathering configuration options from
  command-line arguments, environment variables, and configuration files.
  It is used internally and overrides `cluster.cfg` and `box.cfg` options.

- Auth parameter `cookie_max_age` is now configurable with GraphQL API.
  Also now it's stored in clusterwide config, so changing it on a single server will affect
  all others in cluster.

- Detect that we run under systemd and switch to syslog logging from
  stderr. This allows to filter log messages by severity with
  `journalctl`

- Redesign WebUI

### Changed

- The project renamed to **cartridge**.
  Use `require('cartridge')` instead of `require('cluster')`.
  All submodules are renamed too.
  **(incompatible change)**

- Submodule `cluster.test_helpers` renamed to `cartridge.test-helpers` for consistency.
  **(incompatible change)**

- Modifying auth params with GraphQL before the cluster was bootstrapped is now
  forbidden and returns an error.

- Introducing a new auth parameter `cookie_renew_age`. When cluster handles an HTTP request
  with the cookie, whose age in older then specified, it refreshes the cookie.
  It may be useful to set `cookie_max_age` to a small value (for example 10 minutes),
  so the user will be logged out after `cookie_max_age` seconds of inactivity.
  Otherwise, if he's active, the cookie will be updated every `cookie_renew_age` seconds
  and the session will not be interrupted.

- Changed configuration options for `cluster.cfg()`:
  `roles` now is a mandatory table, `workdir` is optional now (defaults to ".")

- Parameter `advertise_uri` is optional now, default value is derived as follows.
  `advertise_uri` is a compound of `<HOST>` and `<PORT>`.
  When `<HOST>` isn't specified, it's detected as the only non-local IP address.
  If it can't be determined or there is more than one IP address available it
  defaults to `"localhost"`.
  When `<PORT>` isn't specified, it's derived from numeric suffix `_<N>` of
  `TARANTOOL_INSTANCE_NAME`: `<PORT> = 3300+<N>`.
  Otherwise default `<PORT> = 3301` is used.

- Parameter `http_port` is derived from instance name too. If it can't be derived
  it defaults to 8081. New parameter `http_enabled = false` is used to disable it
  (by default it's enabled).

- Removed user `cluster`, which was used internally for orchestration over netbox.
  Tarantool built-in user `admin` is used instead now. It can also be used for HTTP
  authentication to access WebUI. Cluster cookie is used as a password in both cases.
  **(incompatible change)**

### Removed

Two-layer table structure in API, which was deprecated earlier, is now removed completely:

- `cartridge.service_registry.*`
- `cartridge.confapplier.*`
- `cartridge.admin.*`

Instead you can use top-level functions:

- `cartridge.config_get_readonly`
- `cartridge.config_get_deepcopy`
- `cartridge.config_patch_clusterwide`
- `cartridge.service_get`
- `cartridge.admin_get_servers`
- `cartridge.admin_get_replicasets`
- `cartridge.admin_probe_server`
- `cartridge.admin_join_server`
- `cartridge.admin_edit_server`
- `cartridge.admin_expel_server`
- `cartridge.admin_enable_servers`
- `cartridge.admin_disable_servers`
- `cartridge.admin_edit_replicaset`
- `cartridge.admin_get_failover`
- `cartridge.admin_enable_failover`
- `cartridge.admin_disable_failover`

## [0.10.0] - 2019-08-01

### Added

- Cluster can now operate without vshard roles (if you don't need sharding).
  Deprecation warning about implicit vshard roles isn't issued any more,
  they aren't registered unless explicitly specified either in `cluster.cfg({roles=...})`
  or in `dependencies` to one of user-defined roles.

- New role flag `hidden = true`. Hidden roles aren't listed in
  `cluster.admin.get_replicasets().roles` and therefore in WebUI.
  Hidden roles are supposed to be a dependency for another role, yet they still can be
  enabled with `edit_replicaset` function (both Lua and GraphQL).

- New role flag: `permanent = true`.
  Permanent roles are always enabled. Also they are hidden implicitly.

- New functions in cluster test_helpers - `Cluster:upload_config(config)` and `Cluster:download_config()`

### Fixed

- `cluster.call_rpc` used to return 'Role unavailable' error as a first argument
  instead of `nil, err`. It can appear when role is specified in clusterwide config,
  but wasn't initialized properly. There are two reasons for that: race condition,
  or prior error in either role `init` or `apply_config` methods.

## [0.9.2] - 2019-07-12

### Fixed

- Update frontend-core dependency which used to litter
  `package.loaded` with tons of JS code

### Added

- User management page in WebUI
- Configuring multiple isolated vshard groups in a single cluster
- Support for joining multiple instances in a single call to config_patch_clusterwide
- Integration tests helpers

### Changed

- GraphQL API `known_roles` format now includes roles dependencies

- `cluster.rpc_call` option `remote_only` renamed to `prefer_local`
  with the opposite meaning

### Fixed

- Don't display renamed or removed roles in webui
- Uploading config without a section removes it from clusterwide config

## [0.8.0] - 2019-05-20

### Added

- Specifying role dependencies
- Set read-only option for slave nodes
- Labels for servers

### Changed

- Admin http endpoint changed from /graphql to /admin/api
- Graphql output now contains null values for empty objects

- Deprecate implicity of vshard roles
  `'cluster.roles.vshard-storage'`, `'cluster.roles.vshard-router'`.
  Now they should be specified explicitly in `cluster.cfg({roles = ...})`

- `cluster.service_get('vshard-router')` now returns
  `cluster.roles.vshard-router` module instead of `vshard.router`
  **(incompatible change)**

- `cluster.service_get('vshard-storage')` now returns
  `cluster.roles.vshard-storage` module instead of `vshard.storage`
  **(incompatible change)**

- `cluster.admin.bootstrap_vshard` now can be called on any instance


### Fixed

- Operating vshard-storage roles before vshard was bootstrapped

## [0.7.0] - 2019-04-05

- Displaying box.cfg and box.info in WebUI
- Authorization for HTTP API and WebUI
- Configuration download/upload via WebUI
- Lua API documentation, which you can read with `tarantoolctl rocks doc cluster` command.

### Changed

- Instance restart now triggers config validation before roles initialization
- Update WebUI design
- Lua API changed (old functions still work, but issue warnings):
  - `cluster.confapplier.*` -> `cluster.config_*`
  - `cluster.service_registry.*` -> `cluster.service_*`

## [0.6.3] - 2019-02-08

### Fixed

- Cluster used to call 'validate()' role method instead of documented
  'validate_config()', so it was added. The undocumented 'validate()'
  still may be used for the sake of compatibility, but issues a warning
  that it was deprecated.

## [0.6.2] - 2019-02-07
