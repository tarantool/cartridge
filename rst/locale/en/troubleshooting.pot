msgid "Troubleshooting"
msgstr ""

msgid "First of all, see a similar `guide <https://www.tarantool.io/en/doc/latest/book/admin/troubleshoot/>`_ in the Tarantool manual. Below you can find other Cartridge-specific problems considered."
msgstr ""

msgid "Editing clusterwide configuration in WebUI returns an error"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Examples**:"
msgstr ""

msgid "``NetboxConnectError: \"localhost:3302\": Connection refused``;"
msgstr ""

msgid "``Prepare2pcError: Instance state is OperationError, can't apply config in this state``."
msgstr ""

msgid "**The root problem**: all cluster instances are equal, and all of them store a copy of clusterwide configuration, which must be the same. If an instance degrades (can't accept new configuration) -- the quorum is lost. This prevents further configuration modifications to avoid inconsistency."
msgstr ""

msgid "But sometimes inconsistency is needed to repair the system, at least partially and temporarily. It can be achieved by disabling degraded instances."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Solution**:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Connect to the console of the alive instance."
msgstr ""

msgid "Inspect what's going on."
msgstr ""

msgid "If you're ready to proceed, run the following snippet. It'll disable all instances which are not healthy. After that, you can use the WebUI as usual."
msgstr ""

msgid "When it's necessary to bring disabled instances back, re-enable them in a similar manner:"
msgstr ""

msgid "An instance is stuck in the ConnectingFullmesh state upon restart"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Example**:"
msgstr ""

msgid "**The root problem**: after restart, the instance tries to connect to all its replicas and remains in the ``ConnectingFullmesh`` state until it succeeds. If it can't (due to replica URI unavailability or for any other reason) -- it's stuck forever."
msgstr ""

msgid "Set the `replication_connect_quorum <https://www.tarantool.io/en/doc/latest/reference/configuration/#cfg-replication-replication-connect-quorum>`_ option to zero. It may be accomplished in two ways:"
msgstr ""

msgid "By restarting it with the corresponding option set (in environment variables or in the :ref:`instance configuration file <cartridge-run-systemctl-config>`);"
msgstr ""

msgid "Or without restart -- by running the following one-liner:"
msgstr ""

msgid "I want to run an instance with a new advertise_uri"
msgstr ""

msgid "**The root problem**: ``advertise_uri`` parameter is persisted in the clusterwide configuration. Even if it changes upon restart, the rest of the cluster keeps using the old one, and the cluster may behave in an odd way."
msgstr ""

msgid "The clusterwide configuration should be updated."
msgstr ""

msgid "Make sure all instances are running and not stuck in the ConnectingFullmesh state (see :ref:`above <troubleshooting-stuck-connecting-fullmesh>`)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Make sure all instances have discovered each other (i.e. they look healthy in the WebUI)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Run the following snippet in the Tarantool console. It'll prepare a patch for the clusterwide configuration."
msgstr ""

msgid "As a result you'll see a brief summary like the following one:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Finally, apply the patch:"
msgstr ""

msgid "The cluster is doomed, I've edited the config manually. How do I reload it?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Please be aware that it's quite risky and you know what you're doing. There's some useful information about :ref:`clusterwide configuration <cartridge-config>` anatomy and \"normal\" management API."
msgstr ""

msgid "But if you're still determined to reload the configuration manually, you can do (in the Tarantool console):"
msgstr ""

msgid "This snippet reloads the configuration on a single instance. All other instances continue operating as before."
msgstr ""

msgid "If further configuration modifications are made with a two-phase commit (e.g. via the WebUI or with the Lua API), the active configuration of an active instance will be spread across the cluster."
msgstr ""

msgid "Repairing cluster using Cartridge CLI `repair` command"
msgstr ""

msgid "Cartridge CLI has `repair <https://github.com/tarantool/cartridge-cli#repairing-a-cluster>`_ command since version `2.3.0 <https://github.com/tarantool/cartridge-cli/releases/tag/2.3.0>`_."
msgstr ""

msgid "It can be used to get current topology, remove instance from cluster, change repicaset leader or change instance advertise URI."
msgstr ""

msgid "``cartridge repair`` patches the cluster-wide configuration files of application instances placed ON THE LOCAL MACHINE. It means that running ``cartridge repair`` on all machines is user responsibility."
msgstr ""

msgid "It's not enough to apply new configuration: the configuration should be reloaded by the instance. If your application uses ``cartridge >= 2.0.0``, you can simply use ``--reload`` flag to reload configuration. Otherwise, you need to restart instances or reload configuration manually."
msgstr ""

msgid "Changing instance advertise URI"
msgstr ""

msgid "To change instance advertise URI you have to perform these actions:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Start instance with a new advertise URI. The easiest way is to change ``advertise_uri`` value in the :ref:`instance configuration file <cartridge-run-systemctl-config>`)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Make sure instances are running and not stuck in the ConnectingFullmesh state (see :ref:`above <troubleshooting-stuck-connecting-fullmesh>`)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Get instance UUID: * open ``server details`` tab in WebUI; * call ``cartridge repair list-topology --name <app-name>`` and find desired instance UUID: * get instance ``box.info().uuid``:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Now we need to update instance advertise URI in all instances cluster-wide configuration files on each machine. Run ``cartridge repair set-advertise-uri`` with ``--dry-run`` flag on each machine to check cluster-wide config changes computed  by ``cartridge-cli``:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Run ``cartridge repair set-advertise-uri`` without ``--dry-run`` flag on each machine to apply config changes computed by ``cartridge-cli``. If your application uses ``cartridge >= 2.0.0``, you can specify ``--reload`` flag to load new cluter-wide configuration on instances. Otherwise, you need to restart instances or reload configuration manually."
msgstr ""

msgid "Changing replicaset leader"
msgstr ""

msgid "You can change replicaset leader using ``cartridge repair`` command."
msgstr ""

msgid "Get replicaset UUID and new leader UUID (in WebUI or by calling ``cartridge repair list-topology --name <app-name>``)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Now we need to update cluster-wide config for all instances on each machine. Run ``cartridge repair set-leader`` with ``--dry-run`` flag on each machine to check cluster-wide config changes computed by `` cartridge-cli``:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Removing instance from the cluster"
msgstr ""

msgid "You can remove instance from cluster using ``cartridge repair`` command."
msgstr ""

msgid "Now we need to update cluster-wide config for all instances on each machine. Run ``cartridge repair remove-instance`` with ``--dry-run`` flag on each machine to check cluster-wide config changes computed by ``cartridge-cli``:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Run ``cartridge repair remove-instance`` without ``--dry-run`` flag on each machine to apply config changes computed by ``cartridge-cli``. If your application uses ``cartridge >= 2.0.0``, you can specify ``--reload`` flag to load new cluter-wide configuration on instances. Otherwise, you need to restart instances or reload configuration manually."
