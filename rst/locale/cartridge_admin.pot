msgid "This guide explains how to deploy and manage a Tarantool cluster with Tarantool Cartridge."
msgstr ""

msgid "For more information on managing Tarantool instances, see the `server administration section <https://www.tarantool.io/en/doc/latest/book/admin/>`_ of the Tarantool manual."
msgstr ""

msgid "Before deploying the cluster, familiarize yourself with the notion of :ref:`cluster roles <cartridge-roles>` and :ref:`deploy Tarantool instances <cartridge-deploy>` according to the desired cluster topology."
msgstr ""

msgid "Deploying the cluster"
msgstr ""

msgid "To deploy the cluster, first, :ref:`configure <cartridge-config>` your Tarantool instances according to the desired cluster topology, for example:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Then :ref:`start the instances <cartridge-run>`, for example using ``cartridge`` CLI:"
msgstr ""

msgid "And bootstrap the cluster. You can do this via the Web interface which is available at ``http://<instance_hostname>:<instance_http_port>`` (in this example, ``http://localhost:3301``)."
msgstr ""

msgid "In the web interface, do the following:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Depending on the authentication state:"
msgstr ""

msgid "If enabled (in production), enter your credentials and click **Login**:"
msgstr ""

msgid "|nbsp|"
msgstr ""

msgid "If disabled (for easier testing), simply proceed to configuring the cluster."
msgstr ""

msgid "Click **Сonfigure** next to the first unconfigured server to create the first replica set -- solely for the router (intended for *compute-intensive* workloads)."
msgstr ""

msgid "In the pop-up window, check the ``vshard-router`` role -- or any custom role that has ``vshard-router`` as a dependent role (in this example, this is a custom role named ``app.roles.api``)."
msgstr ""

msgid "(Optional) Specify a display name for the replica set, for example ``router``."
msgstr ""

msgid "As described in the :ref:`built-in roles section <cartridge-built-in-roles>`, it is a good practice to enable workload-specific cluster roles on instances running on physical servers with workload-specific hardware."
msgstr ""

msgid "Click **Create replica set** and see the newly-created replica set in the web interface:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Be careful: after an instance joins a replica set, you **CAN NOT** revert this or make the instance join any other replica set."
msgstr ""

msgid "Create another replica set -- for a master storage node (intended for *transaction-intensive* workloads)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Check the ``vshard-storage`` role -- or any custom role that has ``vshard-storage`` as a dependent role (in this example, this is a custom role named ``app.roles.storage``)."
msgstr ""

msgid "(Optional) Check a specific group, for example ``hot``. Replica sets with ``vshard-storage`` roles can belong to different groups. In our example, these are ``hot`` or ``cold`` groups meant to process hot and cold data independently. These groups are specified in the cluster's :ref:`configuration file <cartridge-vshard-groups>`; by default, a cluster has no groups."
msgstr ""

msgid "(Optional) Specify a display name for the replica set, for example ``hot-storage``."
msgstr ""

msgid "Click **Create replica set**."
msgstr ""

msgid "(Optional) If required by topology, populate the second replica set with more storage nodes:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Click **Configure** next to another unconfigured server dedicated for *transaction-intensive* workloads."
msgstr ""

msgid "Click **Join Replica Set** tab."
msgstr ""

msgid "Select the second replica set, and click **Join replica set** to add the server to it."
msgstr ""

msgid "Depending on cluster topology:"
msgstr ""

msgid "add more instances to the first or second replica sets, or"
msgstr ""

msgid "create more replica sets and populate them with instances meant to handle a specific type of workload (compute or transactions)."
msgstr ""

msgid "For example:"
msgstr ""

msgid "(Optional) By default, all new ``vshard-storage`` replica sets get a weight of ``1`` before the ``vshard`` bootstrap in the next step."
msgstr ""

msgid "In case you add a new replica set after ``vshard`` bootstrap, as described in the :ref:`topology change section <cartridge-change-cluster-topology>`, it will get a weight of 0 by default."
msgstr ""

msgid "To make different replica sets store different numbers of buckets, click **Edit** next to a replica set, change its default weight, and click **Save**:"
msgstr ""

msgid "For more information on buckets and replica set's weights, see the `vshard module documentation <https://www.tarantool.io/en/doc/latest/reference/reference_rock/vshard/>`_."
msgstr ""

msgid "Bootstrap ``vshard`` by clicking the corresponding button, or by saying ``cartridge.admin.boostrap_vshard()`` over the administrative console."
msgstr ""

msgid "This command creates virtual buckets and distributes them among storages."
msgstr ""

msgid "From now on, all cluster configuration can be done via the web interface."
msgstr ""

msgid "Updating the configuration"
msgstr ""

msgid "Cluster configuration is specified in a YAML configuration file. This file includes cluster topology and role descriptions."
msgstr ""

msgid "All instances in Tarantool cluster have the same configuration. To this end, every instance stores a copy of the configuration file, and the cluster keeps these copies in sync: as you submit updated configuration in the Web interface, the cluster validates it (and rejects inappropriate changes) and distributes **automatically** across the cluster."
msgstr ""

msgid "To update the configuration:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Click **Configuration files** tab."
msgstr ""

msgid "(Optional) Click **Downloaded** to get hold of the current configuration file."
msgstr ""

msgid "Update the configuration file."
msgstr ""

msgid "You can add/change/remove any sections except system ones: ``topology``, ``vshard``, and ``vshard_groups``."
msgstr ""

msgid "To remove a section, simply remove it from the configuration file."
msgstr ""

msgid "Compress the configuration file as a ``.zip`` archive and click **Upload configuration** button to upload it."
msgstr ""

msgid "You will see a message in the lower part of the screen saying whether configuration was uploaded successfully, and an error description if the new configuration was not applied."
msgstr ""

msgid "Managing the cluster"
msgstr ""

msgid "This chapter explains how to:"
msgstr ""

msgid "change the cluster topology,"
msgstr ""

msgid "enable automatic failover,"
msgstr ""

msgid "switch the replica set's master manually,"
msgstr ""

msgid "deactivate replica sets, and"
msgstr ""

msgid "expel instances."
msgstr ""

msgid "Changing the cluster topology"
msgstr ""

msgid "Upon adding a newly deployed instance to a new or existing replica set:"
msgstr ""

msgid "The cluster validates the configuration update by checking if the new instance is available using the `membership module <https://www.tarantool.io/en/doc/1.10/reference/reference_rock/membership/>`_."
msgstr ""

msgid "The ``membership`` module works over the UDP protocol and can operate before the ``box.cfg`` function is called."
msgstr ""

msgid "All the nodes in the cluster must be healthy for validation success."
msgstr ""

msgid "The new instance waits until another instance in the cluster receives the configuration update and discovers it, again, using the ``membership`` module. On this step, the new instance does not have a UUID yet."
msgstr ""

msgid "Once the instance realizes its presence is known to the cluster, it calls the `box.cfg <https://www.tarantool.io/en/doc/latest/reference/reference_lua/box_cfg/>`_ function and starts living its life."
msgstr ""

msgid "An optimal strategy for connecting new nodes to the cluster is to deploy a new zero-weight replica set instance by instance, and then increase the weight. Once the weight is updated and all cluster nodes are notified of the configuration change, buckets start migrating to new nodes."
msgstr ""

msgid "To populate the cluster with more nodes, do the following:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Deploy new Tarantool instances as described in the :ref:`deployment section <cartridge-deploy>`."
msgstr ""

msgid "If new nodes do not appear in the Web interface, click **Probe server** and specify their URIs manually."
msgstr ""

msgid "If a node is accessible, it will appear in the list."
msgstr ""

msgid "In the Web interface:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Create a new replica set with one of the new instances: click **Configure** next to an unconfigured server, check the necessary roles, and click **Create replica set**:"
msgstr ""

msgid "In case you are adding a new ``vshard-storage`` instance, remember that all such instances get a ``0`` weight by default after the ``vshard`` bootstrap which happened during the initial cluster deployment."
msgstr ""

msgid "Or add the instances to existing replica sets: click **Configure** next to an unconfigured server, click **Join replica set** tab, select a replica set, and click **Join replica set**."
msgstr ""

msgid "If necessary, repeat this for more instances to reach the desired redundancy level."
msgstr ""

msgid "In case you are deploying a new ``vshard-storage`` replica set, populate it with data when you are ready: click **Edit** next to the replica set in question, increase its weight, and click **Save** to start :ref:`data rebalancing <cartridge-rebalance-data>`."
msgstr ""

msgid "As an alternative to the web interface, you can view and change cluster topology via GraphQL. The cluster's endpoint for serving GraphQL queries is ``/admin/api``. You can use any third-party GraphQL client like `GraphiQL <https://github.com/graphql/graphiql>`_ or `Altair <https://altair.sirmuel.design>`_."
msgstr ""

msgid "Examples:"
msgstr ""

msgid "listing all servers in the cluster:"
msgstr ""

msgid "listing all replica sets with their servers:"
msgstr ""

msgid "joining a server to a new replica set with a storage role enabled:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Data rebalancing"
msgstr ""

msgid "Rebalancing (resharding) is initiated periodically and upon adding a new replica set with a non-zero weight to the cluster. For more information, see the `rebalancing process section <https://www.tarantool.io/en/doc/latest/reference/reference_rock/vshard/vshard_admin/#rebalancing-process>`_ of the ``vshard`` module documentation."
msgstr ""

msgid "The most convenient way to trace through the process of rebalancing is to monitor the number of active buckets on storage nodes. Initially, a newly added replica set has 0 active buckets. After a few minutes, the background rebalancing process begins to transfer buckets from other replica sets to the new one. Rebalancing continues until the data is distributed evenly among all replica sets."
msgstr ""

msgid "To monitor the current number of buckets, connect to any Tarantool instance over the :ref:`administrative console <cartridge-manage-sharding-cli>`, and say:"
msgstr ""

msgid "The number of buckets may be increasing or decreasing depending on whether the rebalancer is migrating buckets to or from the storage node."
msgstr ""

msgid "For more information on the monitoring parameters, see the :ref:`monitoring storages section <cartridge-monitor-storage>`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Deactivating replica sets"
msgstr ""

msgid "To deactivate an entire replica set (e.g., to perform maintenance on it) means to move all of its buckets to other sets."
msgstr ""

msgid "To deactivate a set, do the following:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Click **Edit** next to the set in question."
msgstr ""

msgid "Set its weight to ``0`` and click **Save**:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Wait for the rebalancing process to finish migrating all the set's buckets away. You can monitor the current bucket number as described in the :ref:`data rebalancing section <cartridge-rebalance-data>`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Expelling instances"
msgstr ""

msgid "Once an instance is *expelled*, it can never participate in the cluster again as every instance will reject it."
msgstr ""

msgid "To expel an instance, click **...** next to it, then click **Expel server** and **Expel**:"
msgstr ""

msgid "There are two restrictions:"
msgstr ""

msgid "You can't expel a leader if it has a replica. Switch leadership first."
msgstr ""

msgid "You can't expel a vshard-storage if it has buckets. Set the weight to zero and wait until rebalancing is completed."
msgstr ""

msgid "Enabling automatic failover"
msgstr ""

msgid "In a master-replica cluster configuration with automatic failover enabled, if the user-specified master of any replica set fails, the cluster automatically chooses the next replica from the priority list and grants it the active master role (read/write). When the failed master comes back online, its role is restored and the active master, again, becomes a replica (read-only). This works for any roles."
msgstr ""

msgid "To set the priority in a replica set:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Click **Edit** next to the replica set in question."
msgstr ""

msgid "Scroll to the bottom of the **Edit replica set** box to see the list of servers."
msgstr ""

msgid "Drag replicas to their place in the priority list, and click **Save**:"
msgstr ""

msgid "The failover is disabled by default. To enable it:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Click **Failover**:"
msgstr ""

msgid "In the **Failover control** box, click **Enable**:"
msgstr ""

msgid "The failover status will change to enabled:"
msgstr ""

msgid "For more information, see the `replication section <https://www.tarantool.io/en/doc/latest/book/replication/>`_ of the Tarantool manual."
msgstr ""

msgid "Switching the replica set's master"
msgstr ""

msgid "To manually switch the master in a replica set:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Click the **Edit** button next to the replica set in question:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Scroll to the bottom of the **Edit replica set** box to see the list of servers. The server on the top is the master."
msgstr ""

msgid "Drag a required server to the top position and click **Save**."
msgstr ""

msgid "The new master will automatically enter the read/write mode, while the ex-master will become read-only. This works for any roles."
msgstr ""

msgid "Managing users"
msgstr ""

msgid "On the **Users** tab, you can enable/disable authentication as well as add, remove, edit, and view existing users who can access the web interface."
msgstr ""

msgid "Notice that the **Users** tab is available only if authorization in the web interface is :ref:`implemented <cartridge-auth-enable>`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Also, some features (like deleting users) can be disabled in the cluster configuration; this is regulated by the `auth_backend_name <https://www.tarantool.io/en/rocks/cluster/1.0/modules/cluster/#cfg-opts-box-opts>`_ option passed to ``cartridge.cfg()``."
msgstr ""

msgid "Resolving conflicts"
msgstr ""

msgid "Tarantool has an embedded mechanism for asynchronous replication. As a consequence, records are distributed among the replicas with a delay, so conflicts can arise."
msgstr ""

msgid "To prevent conflicts, the special trigger ``space.before_replace`` is used. It is executed every time before making changes to the table for which it was configured. The trigger function is implemented in the Lua programming language. This function takes the original and new values of the tuple to be modified as its arguments. The returned value of the function is used to change the result of the operation: this will be the new value of the modified tuple."
msgstr ""

msgid "For insert operations, the old value is absent, so ``nil`` is passed as the first argument."
msgstr ""

msgid "For delete operations, the new value is absent, so ``nil`` is passed as the second argument. The trigger function can also return ``nil``, thus turning this operation into delete."
msgstr ""

msgid "This example shows how to use the ``space.before_replace`` trigger to prevent replication conflicts. Suppose we have a ``box.space.test`` table that is modified in multiple replicas at the same time. We store one payload field in this table. To ensure consistency, we also store the last modification time in each tuple of this table and set the ``space.before_replace`` trigger, which gives preference to newer tuples. Below is the code in Lua:"

msgstr ""

msgid "This section describes parameters you can monitor over the administrative console."
msgstr ""

msgid "Connecting to nodes via CLI"
msgstr ""

msgid "Each Tarantool node (``router``/``storage``) provides an administrative console (Command Line Interface) for debugging, monitoring, and troubleshooting. The console acts as a Lua interpreter and displays the result in the human-readable YAML format. To connect to a Tarantool instance via the console, say:"
