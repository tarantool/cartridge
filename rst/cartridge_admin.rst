===============================================================================
Tarantool Cartridge administrator's guide
===============================================================================

This guide explains how to deploy and manage a Tarantool cluster with Tarantool
Cartridge.

.. NOTE::

    For more information on managing Tarantool instances, see the
    :ref:`Server administration <admin>` section.

Before deploying the cluster, familiarize yourself with the notion of
:ref:`cluster roles <cartridge-roles>` and
:ref:`deploy Tarantool instances <cartridge-deploy>` according to the
desired cluster topology.

.. _cartridge-deployment:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Deploying the cluster
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To deploy the cluster, first, :ref:`configure <cartridge-config>` your
Tarantool instances according to the desired cluster topology, for example:

.. code-block:: yaml

    my_app.router: {"advertise_uri": "localhost:3301", "http_port": 3301, "workdir": "./tmp/router"}
    my_app.storage_A_master: {"advertise_uri": "localhost:3302", "http_enabled": False, "workdir": "./tmp/storage-a-master"}
    my_app.storage_A_replica: {"advertise_uri": "localhost:3303", "http_enabled": False, "workdir": "./tmp/storage-a-replica"}
    my_app.storage_B_master: {"advertise_uri": "localhost:3304", "http_enabled": False, "workdir": "./tmp/storage-b-master"}
    my_app.storage_B_replica: {"advertise_uri": "localhost:3305", "http_enabled": False, "workdir": "./tmp/storage-b-replica"}

Then :ref:`start the instances <cartridge-run>`, for example using
``cartridge`` CLI:

.. code-block:: console

    cartridge start my_app --cfg demo.yml --run_dir ./tmp/run --foreground

And bootstrap the cluster.
You can do this via the Web interface which is available at
``http://<instance_hostname>:<instance_http_port>``
(in this example, ``http://localhost:3301``).

In the web interface, do the following:

#. Depending on the authentication state:

   * If enabled (in production), enter your credentials and click
     **Login**:

     .. image:: images/auth_creds-border-5px.png
        :align: left
        :scale: 40%

   * If disabled (for easier testing), simply proceed to configuring the
     cluster.

#. Click **Ð¡onfigure** next to the first unconfigured server to create the first
   replica set -- solely for the router (intended for *compute-intensive* workloads).

   .. image:: images/unconfigured-router-border-5px.png
      :align: left
      :scale: 40%

   |nbsp|

   In the pop-up window, check the ``vshard-router`` role -- or any custom role
   that has ``vshard-router`` as a dependent role (in this example, this is
   a custom role named ``app.roles.api``).

   (Optional) Specify a display name for the replica set, for example ``router``.

   .. image:: images/create-router-border-5px.png
      :align: left
      :scale: 40%

   |nbsp|

   .. NOTE::

       As described in the :ref:`built-in roles section <cartridge-built-in-roles>`,
       it is a good practice to enable workload-specific cluster roles on
       instances running on physical servers with workload-specific hardware.

   Click **Create replica set** and see the newly-created replica set
   in the web interface:

   .. image:: images/router-replica-set-border-5px.png
      :align: left
      :scale: 40%

   |nbsp|

   .. WARNING::

       Be careful: after an instance joins a replica set, you **CAN NOT** revert
       this or make the instance join any other replica set.

#. Create another replica set -- for a master storage node (intended for
   *transaction-intensive* workloads).

   Check the ``vshard-storage`` role -- or any custom role
   that has ``vshard-storage`` as a dependent role (in this example, this is
   a custom role named ``app.roles.storage``).

   (Optional) Check a specific group, for example ``hot``.
   Replica sets with ``vshard-storage`` roles can belong to different groups.
   In our example, these are ``hot`` or ``cold`` groups meant to process
   hot and cold data independently. These groups are specified in the cluster's
   :ref:`configuration file <cartridge-vshard-groups>`; by default, a cluster has
   no groups.

   (Optional) Specify a display name for the replica set, for example ``hot-storage``.

   Click **Create replica set**.

   .. image:: images/create-storage-border-5px.png
      :align: left
      :scale: 40%

#. (Optional) If required by topology, populate the second replica set
   with more storage nodes:

   #. Click **Configure** next to another unconfigured server dedicated for
      *transaction-intensive* workloads.

   #. Click **Join Replica Set** tab.

   #. Select the second replica set, and click **Join replica set** to
      add the server to it.

      .. image:: images/join-storage-border-5px.png
         :align: left
         :scale: 40%

#. Depending on cluster topology:

   * add more instances to the first or second replica sets, or
   * create more replica sets and populate them with instances meant to handle
     a specific type of workload (compute or transactions).

   For example:

   .. image:: images/final-cluster-border-5px.png
      :align: left
      :scale: 40%

#. (Optional) By default, all new ``vshard-storage`` replica sets get a weight
   of ``1`` before the ``vshard`` bootstrap in the next step.

   .. NOTE::

       In case you add a new replica set after ``vshard`` bootstrap, as described
       in the :ref:`topology change section <cartridge-change-cluster-topology>`,
       it will get a weight of 0 by default.

   To make different replica sets store different numbers of buckets, click
   **Edit** next to a replica set, change its default weight, and click
   **Save**:

   .. image:: images/change-weight-border-5px.png
      :align: left
      :scale: 40%

   |nbsp|

   For more information on buckets and replica set's weights, see the
   :ref:`vshard module documentation <vshard>`.

#. Bootstrap ``vshard`` by clicking the corresponding button, or by saying
   ``cartridge.admin.boostrap_vshard()`` over the administrative console.

   This command creates virtual buckets and distributes them among storages.

   From now on, all cluster configuration can be done via the web interface.

.. _cartridge-ui-configuration:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Updating the configuration
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cluster configuration is specified in a YAML configuration file.
This file includes cluster topology and role descriptions.

All instances in Tarantool cluster have the same configuration. To this end,
every instance stores a copy of the configuration file, and the cluster
keeps these copies in sync: as you submit updated configuration in
the Web interface, the cluster validates it (and rejects inappropriate changes)
and distributes **automatically** across the cluster.

To update the configuration:

#. Click **Configuration files** tab.

#. (Optional) Click **Downloaded** to get hold of the current configuration file.

#. Update the configuration file.

   You can add/change/remove any sections except system ones:
   ``topology``, ``vshard``, and ``vshard_groups``.

   To remove a section, simply remove it from the configuration file.

#. Compress the configuration file as a ``.zip`` archive and
   click **Upload configuration** button to upload it.

   You will see a message in the lower part of the screen saying whether
   configuration was uploaded successfully, and an error description if the
   new configuration was not applied.

.. _cartridge-change-manage-cluster:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Managing the cluster
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This chapter explains how to:

* change the cluster topology,
* enable automatic failover,
* switch the replica set's master manually,
* deactivate replica sets, and
* expel instances.

.. _cartridge-change-cluster-topology:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Changing the cluster topology
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Upon adding a newly deployed instance to a new or existing replica set:

#. The cluster validates the configuration update by checking if the new instance
   is available using the `membership module <https://www.tarantool.io/en/doc/1.10/reference/reference_rock/membership/>`_.

   .. NOTE::

       The ``membership`` module works over the UDP protocol and can operate before
       the ``box.cfg`` function is called.

   All the nodes in the cluster must be healthy for validation success.

#. The new instance waits until another instance in the cluster receives the
   configuration update and discovers it, again, using the ``membership`` module.
   On this step, the new instance does not have a UUID yet.

#. Once the instance realizes its presence is known to the cluster, it calls
   the ``box.cfg`` function and starts living its life.

   For more information, see the
   :ref:`box.cfg submodule reference <box_introspection-box_cfg>`.

An optimal strategy for connecting new nodes to the cluster is to deploy a new
zero-weight replica set instance by instance, and then increase the weight.
Once the weight is updated and all cluster nodes are notified of the configuration
change, buckets start migrating to new nodes.

To populate the cluster with more nodes, do the following:

#. Deploy new Tarantool instances as described in the
   :ref:`deployment section <cartridge-deploy>`.

   If new nodes do not appear in the Web interface, click **Probe server** and
   specify their URIs manually.

   .. image:: images/probe-server-border-5px.png
      :align: left
      :scale: 40%

   If a node is accessible, it will appear in the list.

#. In the Web interface:

   * Create a new replica set with one of the new instances:
     click **Configure** next to an unconfigured server,
     check the necessary roles, and click **Create replica set**:

     .. NOTE::

         In case you are adding a new ``vshard-storage`` instance, remember that
         all such instances get a ``0`` weight by default after the ``vshard``
         bootstrap which happened during the initial cluster deployment.

         .. image:: images/zero-border-5px.png
            :align: left
            :scale: 40%

   * Or add the instances to existing replica sets:
     click **Configure** next to an unconfigured server, click **Join replica set**
     tab, select a replica set, and click **Join replica set**.

   If necessary, repeat this for more instances to reach the desired
   redundancy level.

#. In case you are deploying a new ``vshard-storage`` replica set, populate it
   with data when you are ready:
   click **Edit** next to the replica set in question, increase its weight, and
   click **Save** to start :ref:`data rebalancing <cartridge-rebalance-data>`.

As an alternative to the web interface, you can view and change cluster topology
via GraphQL. The cluster's endpoint for serving GraphQL queries is ``/admin/api``.
You can use any third-party GraphQL client like
`GraphiQL <https://github.com/graphql/graphiql>`_ or
`Altair <https://altair.sirmuel.design>`_.

Examples:

* listing all servers in the cluster:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     query {
         servers { alias uri uuid }
     }

* listing all replica sets with their servers:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     query {
         replicasets {
             uuid
             roles
             servers { uri uuid }
         }
     }

* joining a server to a new replica set with a storage role enabled:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     mutation {
         join_server(
             uri: "localhost:33003"
             roles: ["vshard-storage"]
         )
     }

.. _cartridge-rebalance-data:

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Data rebalancing
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Rebalancing (resharding) is initiated periodically and upon adding a new replica
set with a non-zero weight to the cluster. For more information, see the
:ref:`rebalancing process section <vshard-rebalancing>`
of the ``vshard`` module documentation.

The most convenient way to trace through the process of rebalancing is to monitor
the number of active buckets on storage nodes. Initially, a newly added replica
set has 0 active buckets. After a few minutes, the background rebalancing process
begins to transfer buckets from other replica sets to the new one. Rebalancing
continues until the data is distributed evenly among all replica sets.

To monitor the current number of buckets, connect to any Tarantool instance over
the :ref:`administrative console <cartridge-manage-sharding-cli>`, and say:

.. code-block:: tarantoolsession

    tarantool> vshard.storage.info().bucket
    ---
    - receiving: 0
      active: 1000
      total: 1000
      garbage: 0
      sending: 0
    ...

The number of buckets may be increasing or decreasing depending on whether the
rebalancer is migrating buckets to or from the storage node.

For more information on the monitoring parameters, see the
:ref:`monitoring storages section <cartridge-monitor-storage>`.

.. _cartridge-deactivate-replica-set:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Deactivating replica sets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To deactivate an entire replica set (e.g., to perform maintenance on it) means
to move all of its buckets to other sets.

To deactivate a set, do the following:

#. Click **Edit** next to the set in question.

#. Set its weight to ``0`` and click **Save**:

   .. image:: images/zero-weight-border-5px.png
      :align: left
      :scale: 40%

#. Wait for the rebalancing process to finish migrating all the set's buckets
   away. You can monitor the current bucket number as described in the
   :ref:`data rebalancing section <cartridge-rebalance-data>`.

.. _cartridge-expelling-instances:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Expelling instances
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. // Describe how to disable instances when it's implemented in UI and
.. // explain the difference.

Once an instance is *expelled*, it can never participate in the cluster again as
every instance will reject it.

To expel an instance, click **...** next to it, then click **Expel server** and
**Expel**:

.. image:: images/expelling-instance-border-5px.png
   :align: left
   :scale: 40%

.. _cartridge-node-failure:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Enabling automatic failover
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In a master-replica cluster configuration with automatic failover enabled, if
the user-specified master of any replica set fails, the cluster automatically
chooses the next replica from the priority list and grants it the active master
role (read/write). When the failed master comes back online, its role is
restored and the active master, again, becomes a replica (read-only). This works
for any roles.

To set the priority in a replica set:

#. Click **Edit** next to the replica set in question.

#. Scroll to the bottom of the **Edit replica set** box to see the list of
   servers.

#. Drag replicas to their place in the priority list, and click **Save**:

   .. image:: images/failover-priority-border-5px.png
      :align: left
      :scale: 40%

The failover is disabled by default. To enable it:

#. Click **Failover**:

   .. image:: images/failover-border-5px.png
      :align: left
      :scale: 40%

#. In the **Failover control** box, click **Enable**:

   .. image:: images/failover-control-border-5px.png
      :align: left
      :scale: 40%

The failover status will change to enabled:

.. image:: images/enabled-failover-border-5px.png
   :align: left
   :scale: 40%

|nbsp|

For more information, see the :ref:`replication section <replication>`.

.. _cartridge-switch-master:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Switching the replica set's master
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To manually switch the master in a replica set:

#. Click the **Edit** button next to the replica set in question:

   .. image:: images/edit-replica-set-border-5px.png
      :align: left
      :scale: 40%

#. Scroll to the bottom of the **Edit replica set** box to see the list of
   servers. The server on the top is the master.

   .. image:: images/switch-master-border-5px.png
      :align: left
      :scale: 40%

#. Drag a required server to the top position and click **Save**.

The new master will automatically enter the read/write mode, while the ex-master
will become read-only. This works for any roles.

.. _cartridge-users:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Managing users
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

On the **Users** tab, you can enable/disable authentication as well as add,
remove, edit, and view existing users who can access the web interface.

.. image:: images/users-tab-border-5px.png
   :align: left
   :scale: 60%

|nbsp|

Notice that the **Users** tab is available only if authorization in the web
interface is :ref:`implemented <cartridge-auth-enable>`.

Also, some features (like deleting users) can be disabled in the cluster
configuration; this is regulated by the
`auth_backend_name <https://www.tarantool.io/en/rocks/cluster/1.0/modules/cluster/#cfg-opts-box-opts>`_
option passed to ``cartridge.cfg()``.

.. _cartridge-resolve-conflicts:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Resolving conflicts
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tarantool has an embedded mechanism for asynchronous replication. As a consequence,
records are distributed among the replicas with a delay, so conflicts can arise.

To prevent conflicts, the special trigger ``space.before_replace`` is used. It is
executed every time before making changes to the table for which it was configured.
The trigger function is implemented in the Lua programming language. This function
takes the original and new values of the tuple to be modified as its arguments.
The returned value of the function is used to change the result of the operation:
this will be the new value of the modified tuple.

For insert operations, the old value is absent, so ``nil`` is passed as the first
argument.

For delete operations, the new value is absent, so ``nil`` is passed as the second
argument. The trigger function can also return ``nil``, thus turning this operation
into delete.

This example shows how to use the ``space.before_replace`` trigger to prevent
replication conflicts. Suppose we have a ``box.space.test`` table that is modified in
multiple replicas at the same time. We store one payload field in this table. To
ensure consistency, we also store the last modification time in each tuple of this
table and set the ``space.before_replace`` trigger, which gives preference to
newer tuples. Below is the code in Lua:

.. code-block:: lua

    fiber = require('fiber')
    -- define a function that will modify the function test_replace(tuple)
            -- add a timestamp to each tuple in the space
            tuple = box.tuple.new(tuple):update{{'!', 2, fiber.time()}}
            box.space.test:replace(tuple)
    end
    box.cfg{ } -- restore from the local directory
    -- set the trigger to avoid conflicts
    box.space.test:before_replace(function(old, new)
            if old ~= nil and new ~= nil and new[2] < old[2] then
                    return old -- ignore the request
            end
            -- otherwise apply as is
    end)
    box.cfg{ replication = {...} } -- subscribe

.. _cartridge-monitor-shard:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Monitoring cluster via CLI
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This section describes parameters you can monitor over the administrative
console.

.. _cartridge-manage-sharding-cli:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Connecting to nodes via CLI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each Tarantool node (``router``/``storage``) provides an administrative console
(Command Line Interface) for debugging, monitoring, and troubleshooting. The
console acts as a Lua interpreter and displays the result in the human-readable
YAML format. To connect to a Tarantool instance via the console, say:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ tarantoolctl connect <instance_hostname>:<port>

where the ``<instance_hostname>:<port>`` is the instance's URI.

.. _cartridge-monitor-storage:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Monitoring storages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use ``vshard.storage.info()`` to obtain information on storage nodes.

.. _cartridge-monitor-storage-issues:

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Potential issues
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

* ``MISSING_MASTER`` â No master node in the replica set configuration.

  **Critical level:** Orange.

  **Cluster condition:** Service is degraded for data-change requests to the
  replica set.

  **Solution:** Set the master node for the replica set in the configuration using API.

* ``UNREACHABLE_MASTER`` â No connection between the master and the replica.

  **Critical level:**

  * If idle value doesnât exceed T1 threshold (1 s.) â Yellow,
  * If idle value doesnât exceed T2 threshold (5 s.) â Orange,
  * If idle value exceeds T3 threshold (10 s.) â Red.

  **Cluster condition:** For read requests to replica, the data may be obsolete
  compared with the data on master.

  **Solution:** Reconnect to the master: fix the network issues, reset the current
  master, switch to another master.

* ``LOW_REDUNDANCY`` â Master has access to a single replica only.

  **Critical level:** Yellow.

  **Cluster condition:** The data storage redundancy factor is equal to 2. It
  is lower than the minimal recommended value for production usage.

  **Solution:** Check cluster configuration:

  * If only one master and one replica are specified in the configuration,
    it is recommended to add at least one more replica to reach the redundancy
    factor of 3.
  * If three or more replicas are specified in the configuration, consider
    checking the replicas' states and network connection among the replicas.

* ``INVALID_REBALANCING`` â Rebalancing invariant was violated. During migration,
  a storage node can either send or receive buckets. So it shouldnât be the case
  that a replica set sends buckets to one replica set and receives buckets from
  another replica set at the same time.

  **Critical level:** Yellow.

  **Cluster condition:** Rebalancing is on hold.

  **Solution:** There are two possible reasons for invariant violation:

  * The ``rebalancer`` has crashed.
  * Bucket states were changed manually.

  Either way, please contact Tarantool support.

* ``HIGH_REPLICATION_LAG`` â Replicaâs lag exceeds T1 threshold (1 sec.).

  **Critical level:**

  * If the lag doesnât exceed T1 threshold (1 sec.) â Yellow;
  * If the lag exceeds T2 threshold (5 sec.) â Orange.

  **Cluster condition:** For read-only requests to the replica, the data may
  be obsolete compared with the data on the master.

  **Solution:** Check the replication status of the replica. Further instructions
  are given in the :ref:`Tarantool troubleshooting guide <admin-troubleshooting-guide>`.

* ``OUT_OF_SYNC`` â Mal-synchronization occured. The lag exceeds T3 threshold (10 sec.).

  **Critical level:** Red.

  **Cluster condition:** For read-only requests to the replica, the data may be
  obsolete compared with the data on the master.

  **Solution:** Check the replication status of the replica. Further instructions
  are given in the :ref:`Tarantool troubleshooting guide <admin-troubleshooting-guide>`.

.. _unreachable_replica:

* ``UNREACHABLE_REPLICA`` â One or multiple replicas are unreachable.

  **Critical level:** Yellow.

  **Cluster condition:** Data storage redundancy factor for the given replica
  set is less than the configured factor. If the replica is next in the queue for
  rebalancing (in accordance with the weight configuration), the requests are
  forwarded to the replica that is still next in the queue.

  **Solution:** Check the error message and find out which replica is unreachable.
  If a replica is disabled, enable it. If this doesnât help, consider checking
  the network.

* ``UNREACHABLE_REPLICASET`` â All replicas except for the current one are unreachable.
  **Critical level:** Red.

  **Cluster condition:** The replica stores obsolete data.

  **Solution:** Check if the other replicas are enabled. If all replicas are
  enabled, consider checking network issues on the master. If the replicas are
  disabled, check them first: the master might be working properly.

Potential issues
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. NOTE::

    Depending on the nature of the issue, use either the UUID of a replica,
    or the UUID of a replica set.

* ``MISSING_MASTER`` â The master in one or multiple replica sets is not
  specified in the configuration.

  **Critical level:** Orange.

  **Cluster condition:** Partial degrade for data-change requests.

  **Solution:** Specify the master in the configuration.

* ``UNREACHABLE_MASTER`` â The ``router`` lost connection with the master of
  one or multiple replica sets.

  **Critical level:** Orange.

  **Cluster condition:** Partial degrade for data-change requests.

  **Solution:** Restore connection with the master. First, check if the master
  is enabled. If it is, consider checking the network.

* ``SUBOPTIMAL_REPLICA`` â There is a replica for read-only requests, but this
  replica is not optimal according to the configured weights. This means that
  the optimal replica is unreachable.

  **Critical level:** Yellow.

  **Cluster condition:** Read-only requests are forwarded to a backup replica.

  **Solution:** Check the status of the optimal replica and its network connection.

* ``UNREACHABLE_REPLICASET`` â A replica set is unreachable for both read-only
  and data-change requests.

  **Critical Level:** Red.

  **Cluster condition:** Partial degrade for read-only and data-change requests.

  **Solution:** The replica set has an unreachable master and replica. Check the
  error message to detect this replica set. Then fix the issue in the same way
  as for :ref:`UNREACHABLE_REPLICA <unreachable_replica>`.
